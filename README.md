<h1>motivator backend</h1>
<h2>what is it</h2>
<p>this is a backed written purely in js wich will be consumed at some point bij a front-end (most likely a pwa)</p>
<p></p>
<p>it reminds you of daily tasks you might either not want to do or simply often forget, such as excercise,read,etc </p>
<p>afterwards you can mark wether you did the task or not based on that the app will give you feedback at the end of each week you get a score rated on how many tasks you completed this gamifies the experience and makes the motivation intrinsic, slacking of will be discouraged since you see your weekly score going down</p>
